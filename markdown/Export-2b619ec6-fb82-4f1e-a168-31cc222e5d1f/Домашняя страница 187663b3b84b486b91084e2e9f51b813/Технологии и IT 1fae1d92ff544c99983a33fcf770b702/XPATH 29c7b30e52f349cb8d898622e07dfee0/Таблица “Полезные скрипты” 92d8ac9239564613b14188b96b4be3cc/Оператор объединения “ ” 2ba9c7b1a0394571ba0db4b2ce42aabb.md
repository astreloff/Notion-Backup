# Оператор объединения “|”

Оператор объединения, который добавляет запрос справа от оператора к набору результатов левого запроса.

"`|`" is not really an "OR operator" in XPath. It permits you to build a node-set composed from substrees of a whole XML tree. "`//book|//cd`" means among all child nodes and descendant of the root node find all ones named 'book' then find also all named 'cd'. If in the descendance of the root node there are only book nodes, your node-set will contain book nodes only. If in the descendance of the root node there are only cd nodes, your node-set will contain cd nodes only. If in the descendance of the root node there are both book and cd nodes, your node-set will contain both book and cd nodes.
