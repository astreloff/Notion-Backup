Multi-award winning, smash-hit SUPERHOT VR blurs the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem. The definitive VR action experience. Time moves only when you move.

No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's you, alone, outnumbered and outgunned. Snatch weapons from fallen enemies to shoot, slice and dodge through a truly cinematic hurricane of slow-motion bullets.
 
It‚Äôs like nothing you have ever played before. Something is different here. Lose track of what‚Äôs real. 

Loved by millions, timeless yet improved, Quest delivers the definitive SUPERHOT VR experience. 

Painstakingly rebuilt as originally destined to be. Nothing distracts from the rush of SUPERHOT‚Äôs signature slow-motion combat. Pyramids within levels are gone. Flow unhindered through the action like a ballerina of death. 

No tethers. No compromise.
