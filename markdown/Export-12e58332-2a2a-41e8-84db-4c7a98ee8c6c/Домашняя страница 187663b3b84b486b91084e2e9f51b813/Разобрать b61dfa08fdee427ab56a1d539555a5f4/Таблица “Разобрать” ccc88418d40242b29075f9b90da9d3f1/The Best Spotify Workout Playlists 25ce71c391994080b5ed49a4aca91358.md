Having the right kind of music in your ears in the gym is an important thing to consider when going for the glory of the fifth set. If you’re doing it right, the fourth set of any exercise will take you out. Finishing that up and then doing another entire set on a destroyed body area is largely dependent on what’s massaging your ear drums. That’s where [Spotify](https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2019/12/lorem-spotify-playlist) playlists come in. These curated lists extract the adrenaline from your blood with electrifying tunes that power the senses into the next set—but only if you find the right ones.

That’s where we come in. After hours of research and gym workouts (not solely for this story in particular, summer is around the corner), we’ve put together a list of 17 [Spotify playlists](https://www.complex.com/music/best-spotify-playlists/) that are perfect for gym use. Combine these with access to both [Gatorade](http://www.complex.com/tag/gatorade) and a water fountain, and you might become the yelling, weight-dropping gym rat that always existed within, but has never surfaced. You can thank finally having the right music for this new discovery about yourself.

## Get Turnt

This one’s pretty self-explanatory. Turning up isn’t just reserved for a concert or the club you’re planning on hitting up after your workout. You can start the process right in the gym. From Drake to Meek Mill to Migos, Get Turnt will have your whole workout going apeshit. Just make sure you get some actual weight lifting in in-between doing The Backpack and the shoot dance, alright?

## Cali Fire

It’s no secret that the California sound, with its furious bounce and spilling energy, is in right now. It started long before Blueface’s “Thotiana” became a remix machine for “iana” original words, but the world has become obsessed with it, and songs that sound like it. Cali Fire is a playlist that captures the essence of this energetic sound and its share of electric content makes it a standard for gym time consumption. “Bleed It” by Blueface and “Pure Water” by Migos (produced by DJ Mustard) are but two of the similarly magnetic anthems included on this playlist. Elsewhere, you’ll find music from SOBxRBE, Tyra, Vince Staples, and more. These records continuously spill energy, and you can hear it in the frantic nature of the artists' deliveries. If these don’t get the blood going, the problem may not be in the music.

## Marshawn Lynch’s Beast Mode

Marshawn Lynch’s Beast Mode playlist is the best soundtrack for your pre-game warm-up. The playlist is packed with tracks that are bound to get your mind in the zone and body feeling loose. Despite the title, this playlist isn’t exactly jam-packed with high-intensity tracks, though, and instead oozes west coast influences with artists like Snoop Dogg, E-40, Luniz, and Mac Dre. There are a handful of smooth and mellow songs that help establish a steady workout routine. Set the tone with Snoop Dogg’s “Wrong Idea,” practice your footwork to The Jacka’s “Bay Area Championship” or cool down to Amerie’s “Nothing Like Loving You.”

## Gymshark | David Laid

David Laid is a 21-year-old bodybuilder. His playlist for Gymshark, a fitness apparel and lifestyle company based in the United Kingdom, reflects both his youth and seriousness in the fitness profession with the kind of hand-picked tunes that make you clench your jawline and biceps while listening. If this is truly what he listens to in the gym, I can definitely see why. Laid's playlist features some of your more typical energy-inducing tunes like Skrillex’s remix to Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.” But there are also some stranger choices like “This Time” by Kayzo and “Smoke Bomb” by Datsik and Snoop Dogg. A common theme throughout all of these choices is rage; you’ll want to throw down the weights you'rw using after every set because of the furious techno screams wailing in your ears. You’ll want to mimic the drums in the air and you’ll probably shake your head side to side while your mouth is shriveled up. It’s some hard stuff and we best recommend listening to this while you’re in an empty gym. But it’s kickass enough to power you through the last leg of that workout, so there should definitely be some use for it. Just don’t embarrass yourself.

## Stepping Out

Out of Spotify’s curated gym playlists, Stepping Out does the best to get the blood flowing with its myriad of bass drums and ride cymbals. “Dawnbreaker” by Metrik is soft and inviting, while “Anarchy” is harsh and vicious—grating even. These opposites exist in a larger spectrum across all genres, where almost anything is possible once you press shuffle. Sometimes it feels like a science fiction soundtrack, other times it sounds like the chase music that comes on while escaping the cops on a *Need for Speed* video game. My personal favorite gym tune here is “Masochist - Original Mix” by Pendulum because it feels elastic with its sharp noises and excited percussive boards. It encapsulates the sound of the playlist and what it can be in its entirety—a funky, kick-ass collection of angry tunes for angry sets.

## New Wave Rap

I must confess: I find SoundCloud rap, mostly from 2016 to late 2017, to be some of the most engrossing music in recent history. There’s true creativity and grit in its rawness that makes it very appealing—especially for workouts. New Wave Rap is a playlist that captures this sound and aesthetic, in a collection of over one hundred songs. It’s lengthy, but once it’s consumed, you’ll see why. This energetic mix of Famous Dex, Yung Bans, Marcy Mane, Playboi Cardi, LUCKI, and others may not be strictly made with the gym in mind, but its stylish artists and dominating bass make it perfect for immersing oneself in while between sets. I’ve been following it for a year now and it continues to grow and incorporate new identities. In the gym, it can be the difference between stopping on the treadmill after 15 minutes or after an hour.

## Clout Culture

The name is as corny as can be, but Clout Culture (I typed that twice and I feel like I need to wash my hands) is all about the youth and the energy that young music brings. It features the next generation of rap stars like Comethazine and Lil Mosey, who bring their most heart-pumping hits to the forefront. Since these artists are from a new era where attention is currency, the music reflects that. Cadences are unique and energy is never shared This playlist is about carving ones niche instead of fitting into one. It does wonders for creating energy by exposing you to different kinds of music that elicit new emotions with each song change.

## Cardio

Don’t let the title of this playlist steer you away. While Spotify’s Cardio playlist is certainly a fine option for when you want to get in a quick three miles, the tracks within are equally as satisfying for a 45-minute pump session. From frenzied remixes of current hits, like the Hazers’ remix of Dua Lupa’s “IDGAF,” to the endlessly replayable “Jackie Chan” from Tiesto and Post Malone, Cardio gets your heart pumping.

## Gold School

There are certain hip-hop tracks that force you to bob your head up and down the minute you hear them. The beat drop on Eminem’s “The Way I Am.” The iconic first note on DMX’s “Ruff Ryder’s Anthem.” The Neptunes’ signature sound on Ludacris’ “Southern Hospitality.” Someone put all of these bad boys in one place for you to head nod to while you get a workout in. Bless their soul.
