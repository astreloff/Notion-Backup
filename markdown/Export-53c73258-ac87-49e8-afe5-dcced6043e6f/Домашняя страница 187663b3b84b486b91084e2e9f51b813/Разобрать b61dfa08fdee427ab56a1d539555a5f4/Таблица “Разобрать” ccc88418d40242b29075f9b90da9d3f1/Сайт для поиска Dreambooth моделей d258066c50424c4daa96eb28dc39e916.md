I wanted to share a passion project we’ve been working on for the last few weeks; an open-source, free-to-use site for sharing and rating models! The Stable Diffusion community has created loads of great models with more every day, our hope is to provide a user-friendly way to share, browse, and review models.

We liked HuggingFace’s concept of being a model repository, but felt it was missing a few things that would really allow it to serve as the home for models long term. Such as:

- A way for creators to tag models with things that make sense to the SD community
- A good way for people interested in the model to review and share their creations
- A simpler upload and download interface (how many of us are really familiar with code repos)
- An indexed and visual browsing experience of all the models available
- An API that can be used by SD tools to tap into the growing library of models, embeds, aesthetic gradients, and hyper networks available

We’re inspired daily by the incredible things this community is creating. We’re thrilled to be able to throw our hat into the ring to try and provide a service that will help this community continue to thrive. We’re excited to get your feedback, and invite you to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZhhzhXbxFb) or to create an issue or share an idea on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/civitai/civitai)

P.S. To the creators who’s models we’ve already uploaded to the site, thank you for sharing your awesome models, please reach out so that we can move the ownership of these models to you.
